# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overiview

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to polish up a web app to utilize scraping and include four of Mars's hemisphere images using BeautifulSoup and Splinter. The full-resolution images of these hemisphers and their respective titles were scraped from the marshemispheres website and stored on a Mongo database. A web application was then used to display the data and accomodate the images. 

## Changes Made to index.html for Deliverable 3 

### Mobile Responsive

The website was made mobile-responsive by using a col-md-12, col-md-8, col-md-6, col-md-4 grid type system.
